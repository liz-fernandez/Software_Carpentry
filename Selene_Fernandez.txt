My name is Selene Fernandez-Valverde. I'm a genomicist and bioinformatician.
Until recently I worked at School of Biological Sciences in the University of Queensland as a Postdoctoral Researcher. 
I now hold a junior faculty position at the National Laboratory for Genomic Biodiversity in Mexico (LANGEBIO). 
I'm a founder of MÃ¡s Ciencia por Mexico (More Science For Mexico) a civil organization aimed at promoting science and technology in Mexico.
I am an advocate of good practice in science and informatics and have long lived love for all things related to gene regulation and RNA.
